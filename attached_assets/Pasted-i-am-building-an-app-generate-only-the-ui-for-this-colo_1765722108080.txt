i am building an app.

generate only the ui for this.
 color scheme:Use a dark, premium, and intentional color system designed to support focus, clarity, and self-improvement rather than stimulation. The primary base should be deep charcoal and near-black tones (not pure black) to reduce eye strain and create a calm, immersive environment. Text and primary UI elements should use soft off-white and warm gray for high readability without harsh contrast. Accent colors must be muted and desaturated, drawing from deep blues, soft teals, slate purples, brushed silver, and restrained amber—used sparingly to guide attention, indicate active states, and highlight progress or achievements. Avoid neon, overly saturated, or high-dopamine colors. Gradients should be subtle and smooth, with gentle transitions that add depth without visual noise. Shadows, glows, and borders should be soft and minimal, giving components a refined, floating feel. Overall, the palette should feel modern, disciplined, and aspirational—visually rich yet quiet—perfectly aligned with a self-improvement app that prioritizes focus, consistency, and long-term growth over distraction.

problem statement: so you know how recently the self improvement and the red pill genre has been rising in popularity and people have been actively watching self improvement content on instagram and youtube shorts. at the same time, people's attention span has also been declining because of the popularity of the short form content. there is also a huge popularity in the viewership of podcasts. now the young people who want to watch podcasts cant watch the entire 2 or 3 hour long ones because their attention span has declined.

problems faced by users: the people who do want to start their self improvement journey by curating the videos they watch on their phone cant do so because , say, the user has followed a self improvement content creator on instagram, that user can get distracted by the other genre's reels which are made to be more addictive.

our solution: there is an app which only hosts self improvement related content that is podcasts in a short form such that it caters to the short attention span of the younger generation while at the same time provides a distraction free platform for them.

what we do: we take existing 2 3 hour long podcasts from youtube and other platforms. then we put those long podcasts and turn them into 1 minute or less sized clips of meaningful size such that it does not break of in between a sentence. basically each individual clip should have a meaning . then the set of clips are put through a recommendation system model and all such clips are then showed to the user such that when the user opens our app. he or she only sees small sized clips of podcasts of a specific genre.

For the Login Page

Design a modern, premium login screen for a self-improvement app called Bitecast, inspired by a clean, minimalist aesthetic. The background should use a deep charcoal-to-black gradient with subtle texture or soft noise to avoid flatness, creating a calm yet powerful first impression. Place the Bitecast logo/wordmark centered at the top in a smooth, elegant font (slightly rounded or handwritten-style for warmth), in soft off-white or muted silver for contrast. Below it, include two rounded input fields for Email/Username and Password, styled in dark slate gray with gentle inner shadows and light placeholder text. Add a small, understated “Forgot password?” link aligned to the right in a muted accent color like cool blue or teal. The primary Log in button should be bold yet refined—use a deep blue or desaturated teal with soft glow or elevation to make it stand out without feeling aggressive. Below, include alternative login options with minimal icons and text: “Continue with Google”, followed by a subtle divider and the option to sign up if the user doesn’t have an account. Maintain generous spacing, smooth rounded corners, and micro-interactions (hover/press states) to make the UI feel alive, attractive, and aspirational—motivating but not flashy, premium but not dull, perfectly aligned with a focused self-improvement brand.

For the story page

Design a full-screen, immersive content feed page for the Bitecast self-improvement app that maintains the same dark, premium, and focused aesthetic as the login screen. The page should feature vertically scrollable, story-style or reel-style content that fills the entire screen, with visuals subtly dimmed using a soft dark vignette or gradient overlay to keep the mood calm and intentional rather than flashy. Use a deep black / charcoal base with warm highlights so the content feels cinematic and reflective, not distracting. Minimal UI elements should float over the content: at the top, display the creator’s name and timestamp in small, clean off-white text; keep icons thin, subtle, and low-contrast to avoid clutter. At the bottom-right corner, add a small circular profile avatar with a soft border or faint glow, resembling an account profile photo—this should feel elegant and unobtrusive while signaling identity and personalization. Interactions (tap, swipe, hold) should feel smooth and deliberate, with micro-animations that reinforce focus and mindfulness. Overall, the page should feel like a quiet, high-quality space for intentional consumption, visually rich yet restrained, aligned perfectly with a self-improvement brand that values depth over dopamine.

Reels Page

Design a full-screen Reels Page for the Bitecast app that maintains the same dark, refined, self-improvement–focused aesthetic used across the platform. The background should be a deep black or charcoal tone, allowing the video to take full visual priority while subtle dark gradients at the top and bottom improve readability without distraction. The video occupies the central vertical canvas with no unnecessary borders, creating an immersive and intentional viewing experience. On the right-hand side, stack interaction icons—like, comment, react, and share—using clean, minimal line icons sized proportionally for comfortable tapping (not oversized, not cramped), with consistent spacing and a soft off-white or muted gray color; active states can use a restrained accent like desaturated blue or teal. At the bottom-left, display the creator’s circular profile photo, channel name, and video title in a clear hierarchy: profile icon small but crisp, channel name slightly emphasized, and title in subtle, readable text. Navigation icons at the top (back and expand) should remain minimal and unobtrusive. Overall, icon sizing, spacing, and typography should feel balanced, ergonomic, and premium, ensuring the page feels polished, calm, and visually satisfying while reinforcing Bitecast’s identity as a focused, high-quality self-improvement reels experience.

Home Page

Design a premium Home Page for the Bitecast self-improvement app, following the same dark, focused, and subtly aspirational color scheme established across the platform. The top section must visually resemble the provided stories header layout, with a horizontal row of circular story avatars aligned just below the status bar. Each story avatar should have a thin, elegant ring using muted gradients (deep blue, soft teal, desaturated violet, or brushed silver) that feel refined and motivational rather than flashy. Story profile images remain crisp and centered, with clean typography below each circle for names in soft off-white text. To the left of the story row, place a minimal bell icon for notifications, styled in a subtle off-white/gray to match the theme without stealing attention.

Below this fixed stories header, the page should scroll vertically into the main content feed, transitioning smoothly into the immersive, reel-style or post-style feed previously described. The feed should feel spacious and calm, with soft dark overlays and intentional spacing to reinforce distraction-free consumption. At the bottom of the screen, include a persistent navigation bar with clean, well-proportioned icons only: home (active state highlighted softly), reels, explore (magnifying glass), library, and profile—all monochrome or gently accented to maintain consistency. Use smooth micro-interactions, balanced icon sizing, rounded edges, and subtle elevation to ensure the interface feels polished, ergonomic, and premium, creating a seamless flow from stories at the top to focused content below, perfectly aligned with Bitecast’s self-improvement ethos.

Explore Page

Design the Explore Page for the Bitecast app with the same dark, premium, and motivational color palette used across the platform, ensuring visual consistency and brand depth. At the top of the page, display a grid of large, rounded square discovery cards (2-column layout) that act as exploration entry points. Each card should use rich but muted accent colors—deep navy, burnt orange, muted purple, charcoal gray, and desaturated magenta—set against the dark background, with soft shadows and smooth rounded corners. Inside each card, place sample genre names in bold, clean typography such as Mindset, Discipline, Finance, Fitness, Philosophy, Productivity, Mental Health, and Habits, aligned confidently and balanced with subtle abstract imagery or cropped visuals that feel aspirational rather than loud.

Once the user scrolls past these square discovery cards, the layout should seamlessly transition into a clean, minimal vertical feed resembling the attached second image: evenly spaced rectangular content tiles with generous white/negative space converted here into soft dark spacing, maintaining calm visual rhythm and readability. The feed should feel structured, breathable, and intentional—designed for exploration without overwhelm. Use consistent margins, subtle separators, and restrained motion to guide the eye naturally. Overall, the Explore Page should feel curated, elegant, and discovery-driven, encouraging users to explore new self-improvement content while staying grounded in Bitecast’s refined, distraction-free design philosophy.

Library Page

Design the Library Page for the Bitecast self-improvement app with a calm, premium layout that closely mirrors the provided reference image while fully adhering to the app’s dark, elegant, and distraction-free color scheme. The page should use a deep charcoal or near-black background, with content cards standing out through subtle contrast, soft shadows, and rounded corners. Structure the page as a vertical stack of horizontal carousels. The first carousel is the Liked section, followed by the Saved section as the second carousel—each containing clean, evenly spaced rectangular content thumbnails that scroll horizontally. Below these, include multiple genre-based carousels (for example: Mindset, Discipline, Finance, Fitness, Philosophy, Productivity), each clearly labeled with understated off-white typography and generous spacing to avoid visual clutter. At the very bottom, place a distinct “Not Interested” section, visually de-emphasized using darker tones, lower contrast, or reduced opacity to signal separation from preferred content while keeping the experience respectful and clean. Maintain consistent thumbnail sizing, smooth horizontal scrolling, and refined micro-interactions throughout. Overall, the Library Page should feel organized, intentional, and premium, reinforcing Bitecast as a personal, thoughtfully curated space for long-term self-improvement content.

Profile Page

Design a standard Profile Page for the Bitecast self-improvement app that follows the same dark, premium, and focused design language used throughout the platform. The top section of the profile must closely resemble the provided reference: a centered circular profile avatar with a soft glow or subtle ring, followed by the user’s name and handle in clean, high-contrast off-white text. Below this, display a compact stats row highlighting key metrics such as content watched, total focus time, and current streak, using minimal icons and muted accent colors (desaturated blue or soft teal) to maintain clarity without visual noise. Include a refined “Edit Profile” button with rounded corners, subtle elevation, and a restrained accent outline that feels premium rather than flashy.

As the user scrolls down, the page should transition into a simple, vertically stacked list of standard social-media-style options, each presented as clean, tappable rows with subtle separators. These options can include items like Account Settings, Privacy & Security, Notifications, Saved Content, Activity History, Goals & Preferences, Help & Support, and Log Out. Use consistent iconography, balanced spacing, and soft hover/press micro-interactions to keep the experience intuitive and calm. The entire page should feel organized, personal, and intentional, reinforcing Bitecast as a platform that treats self-improvement as a long-term journey rather than a noisy social feed.
